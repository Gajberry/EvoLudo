/**
 * The module for investigating the evolutionary dynamics of the continuous
 * snowdrift game, or more generally, interactions among pairs of individuals
 * with continuous traits. A range of cost and benefit functions determine the
 * payoffs to the interacting individuals. The characteristics of the
 * interaction sensitively depend on the cost and benefit functions as well as
 * the function parameters. For example, for the continuous games the cost and
 * benefit functions \(C(x), B(x)\), are typically assumed to be smooth,
 * strictly increasing functions that satisfy \(B(0)=C(0)=0\) and
 * \(B(x)&gt;C(x)\) at least for small \(x\), where \(x\) denotes the continuous
 * trait, or the investment level. This means that no investements provide no
 * benefits but also entail no costs but benefits, at least for small
 * investments, exceed the costs.
 * <p>
 * In the continuous prisoner's dilemma the payoff to an \(x\)-strategist facing
 * an individual with strategy \(y\) is thus given by
 * \[P(x,y)=B(y)-C(x),\]
 * which means the benefits only depend on the opponents trait while the costs
 * only depend on the player's own trait. Clearly the only way for the \(x\)
 * strategist to increase its payoff is to lower the investment level. The same
 * applies to the \(y\) strategist and hence without any further mechanisms the
 * investment levels will invariably decrease and cooperation vanish, just as in
 * the traditional discrete prisoner's dilemma with the two fixed traits of
 * cooperation and defection.
 * <p>
 * In contrast, in the continuous snowdrift game the payoff to an
 * \(x\)-strategist facing an individual with strategy \(y\) is thus given by
 * \[Q(x,y)=B(x+y)-C(x),\]
 * which means that the benefit that the \(x\)-strategist obtains is based on
 * the total cooperative investment made by both agents, while the costs depend
 * only on its own trait, just as before. Because of \(B(x)&gt;C(x)\) this
 * implies that it is always advantageous for an individual to make a (small)
 * cooperative investment if its partner is not doing so. As a consequence we
 * might expect that cooperative investment levels evolve towards some non-zero
 * level. As it turns out, the evolutionary dynamics is much richer and is
 * analytically tractable using the framework of adaptive dynamics. In
 * particular, it is possible that a population spontaneously split through
 * evolutionary branching into two stably co-existing phenotypes of high and low
 * investors. This dynamic provides an intriguing evolutionary pathway for the
 * origin and emergence discrete traits as assumed in classical
 * {@code 2Ã—2} interactions.
