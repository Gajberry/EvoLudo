TODO:

- EvoLudo(Web).isEPub should not be static; add command line option to set features (would help with testing/debugging ePub features); e.g. --gui epub:nomouse:nokeys possible solution to override isEPub setting if lab is running in non-linear page.

ePub:
- labs in text flow:
	- do not add wheel listeners to canvas (ignored by ibooks);
	- ignore key events (except for 'alt' provided that ePubReaderTouchSupport); note: isShowing is not working in ePubs and hence key events are sent to all labs (at least in current chapter).
	- ignore/reimagine context menu (set timer after touchstart etc.)
	- ignore drag'n'drop 
- labs on non-linear pages:
	- same as web browser?
	- check export
	- touch events still require special attention
	- include drag'n'drop if reader has mouse support
- scrolling of MVConsole does not work (likely blocked by iBooks); cannot seem to force scrollbar visibility; context menu shows up but does not work (interferes with marking of text); remove MVConsole?
- highlighting does not work; likely caused by TouchEvents (appears that touchmove and mousemove interfere; try to avoid loading of TouchEvents and replace by ibooks.js (see Fixed Layout example).)
- logging in ePubs is painful - fails on any invalid character
	- newlines are a challenge in MVConsole output
	- new class ConsoleLogHandler encodes log messages to prevent crashes when logging to iBooks console. leads to some duplicate encodings; review with MVConsole log handlers in mind
	- disable console logging in ePubs except for debugging?
- zooming with mouse does not work (probably blocked by iBooks); check if preventDefault helps or remove listeners?
- surprisingly drag'n'drop works even in ePubs; is this needed or confusing?

Minor:
- GWT: drop cursor does not show during drag'n'drop
- MersenneTwister maintains (undesirable) dependency on EvoLudo for encoding state


DONE:
+ ePubs no longer throw errors! macOS TouchEvents patched
+ setting of status after parsing errors works but immediately gets overridden.
+ provide logger to test routines in MersenneTwister; must not rely on EvoLudo stuff
+ restored ODE/SDE states won't run...
+ PDE states not (yet) saved/restored
+ --mutation has issues at least with cSD (reverts param to -1 or claims --mutation is an unknown option)
+ --run ignored
+ check if exchange of evoludo states between GWT and JRE is possible -> possible and works!
+ align restored dynamics and original one (kaleidoscopes provide good starting point) -> restoreFitness must set scores _and_ recalculate fitness
+ JRE frequent concurrent modification error in FrameLayer.paintComponent when iterating through tickLabels... -> synchronization added (hackish...)
+ GWT chrome saves dataURL of svg's only up to first '#' character... -> needs to be escaped
+ JRE: command line options for save/restore
+ JRE: adapt PlistParser, PlistReader to work again with file input/output -> not needed, work with strings
+ save more state data (e.g. absorbed etc.) -> not more data needed but updating strategiesTypeCount/Mean
+ GWT: file chooser for save/restore -> ok for restore; impossible for save but now download is triggered, which works in most browsers
+ save/restore RNG state
