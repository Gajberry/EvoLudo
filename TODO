EXTENSIONS:
- review migration

TASKS:
- convince maven to read resource files from src/main/resources rather than src/main/java/org/evoludo/simulator/resources
- enable offline compilation of GWT module ('mvn -pl EvoLudoGWT gwt:compile' throws 'java.lang.RuntimeException: java.net.UnknownHostException: www.w3.org', more specifically: Generator 'com.google.gwt.uibinder.rebind.UiBinderGenerator' threw an exception while rebinding 'org.evoludo.EvoLudoWeb.EvoLudoWebBinder')
- refactor EvoLudo/GWT/JRE: should not deal with GUI related code (--delay, --run); move all methods related to delay and isSuspended (except delay variable) to superclass of EvoLudoWeb and EvoLudoLab
- javadoc for EvoLudoJRE module

TODO:
- reverting PDE model to ODE e.g. for well-mixed structures fails (must re-parse command line options)
- HistoGraph should only hold its own data (possibly sharing norm with others); Histogram must coordinate differnt histograms and data retrieval
- move generation of degree histograms to Geometry
- ephemeral scoring is too slow (about half the speed of adjusting scores; should be faster, though)
- check if interactions-array can be replaced by interaction.kout for adjustScores (but only if read-only access is ensured)!
- merge options cloSamples and cloRuns?
- implement custom color maps (NetGames is an example); this is tricky due to incompatibilities between JRE and GWT; one possibility is to add relevant code to EvoLudoJRE and EvoLudoGWT (inelegant because it requires synchronizing code across two not obviously related classes); another possibility is to add <lab>GWT and <lab>JRE classes to take care of the implementation specific components (much like the original <lab>Lab class setup); both are far from satisfactory or even elegant solutions...
- fixation probability does not seem to work if initfreqs is e.g. 1:1. this is not intuitive. either change the x-axis from node to something more meaningful and report results graphically or display a message.
- check reference lines for fixation probabilities and times (seem to be off for Moran on test page and do not seem to get updated e.g. when changing population size).

Browser:

iOS:
- export on iOS fails (disable or check if data url's work)

iBooks (desktop):
- standalone: tooltips fail to display colors of nodes in 2D/3D (both strategies and fitness)
- standalone: clo options textarea disabled/read-only (corresponding buttons ok)
- standalone: cannot change view (eliminates all entries from view selector)
- LinearGraph: shifting/zooming view does not work (shift sets x-axis [-1,0] to [0,1], zoom out changes to [0,0]...)

touch:
- pinch zoom works on touch pad but zoom direction is flipped as compared to iPad (does this make sense...?)

ePub:
- important: standalone pages report as ePub in iBooks desktop but false on iBooks on iPad (i.e. export menu is active but not working...)
- touch events require special attention; work different from browser; restrict to mouse events? currently tooltips and context menu are interfering
- pinch zoom has issues for LineGraph (work reasonably well e.g. for PopGraph2D and well for PopGraph3D, including shifting/rotating of view)
- parameter textarea does not show parameters, possibly white on white, may need explicitly setting color of disabled text (iPad only; desktop ok and standalone on iPad ok as well)

Minor:
- add color to Test output
- center histograms
- switch y-axis labels to left side of graphs? maybe with the exception of LineGraph? make it configurable.
- GWT: drop cursor does not show during drag'n'drop

Enhancements:
- implement progress reporting for Test's


CHECK:


DONE:
+ implement different types of mutations for discrete modules: random (cosmic rays) or errors in reproduction (temperature).
+ check ephemeral scoring (should yield qualitatively the same results as the detailled accounting)
+ check --accuscores flag (for regular networks this should merely result in a change of selection strength but seems to change more...)
+ more streamlining of clo parameters (merge --costfcn and --costparams into --costs; merge --benefitfcn and --benefitparams into --benefits; absorb --mutationtype and --mutationsdev in --mutation; absorb --init in --inittype and rename --inittype to --init)
+ maven plugin to assemble html files and compiled evoludoweb JavaScript for debugging and deploying -> EvoLudoDev module
+ maven plugin to run tests -> EvoLudoTest module
+ reconfigure maven with 'webapp' and 'jettyconf' folders in EvoLudoGWT instead of EvoLudoJRE -> EvoLudoDev module
+ Safari (desktop & iPadOS): 3D graphs not shown after view change (or on load) for dynamical layout; tooltips trigger display (works in Chrome, Firefox and Safari for iOS)
+ debugging of single updates re-implemented; improved logging for debugging
+ streamline cloOptimize: defined both in IBS and IBSPopulation but set only in IBSDPopulation...
+ highlighting does not work; likely caused by TouchEvents (appears that touchmove and mousemove interfere; try to avoid loading of TouchEvents and replace by ibooks.js (see Fixed Layout example, i.e. how does it prevent the loading of TouchEvents).)
+ MersenneTwister maintains (undesirable) dependency on EvoLudo for encoding state
+ eliminate interactions-array if hasLookupTable (or adjustScores)
+ unify getMeanTraits and getMeanState in CXPopulation and DPopulation respectively; improve dealings with range of continuous traits
+ drag'n'drop restore does not work on popup labs
+ game implementations must advertise what kind of graphics views they support, for example by implementing particular interfaces; the current triage based on discrete/continuous strategies is too coarse and based on game classes is too narrow and inflexible.
+ add --adjusted option to ODEEuler and PDEReactionDiffusion to switch to adjusted replicator dynamics. simply divide dy by avg. fitness in all update variants. must ensure positive payoffs.
+ switching to --popupdate S with geometry != well-mixed should trigger warning and reset GUI (surprisingly challenging...); switching to --popupdate D works but existing structure/network is not updated in GUI. 
+ add pseudo-game Test to run various tests
+ move control of model to engine (EvoLudoLab and EvoLudoWeb should only deal with gui stuff)
+ move cloRun to EvoLudo (including isSuspended and potentially isRunning); now code duplication in EvoLudoLab and EvoLudoWeb
+ tooltips do not work towards left part of canvas (findNode seems to fail)
+ review groupScores: should return traitScores (just like avgScores and meanScores); delete 'me', should be included in group; group should be trait counts not indexes.
+ cannot seem to stop simulations on page flip; maybe at least prevent more than one from running? (done but needs testing - ok)
+ ePub triggers should be typeset using html and css only - no need to get javascript involved!
+ ePub context menu not working (intentional?) - no!
+ tap moves background of popup labs (i.e. behind overlay)
+ add double tap for setting initial frequencies in S3Graph and ParaGraph
+ shaking of 3D graphs with keys in overlay is passed to graphs below (ok for 2D graphs)
+ fullscreen not working (except in safari): size of graphs not adjusted - now working in Safari & Chrome; minor scaling issues in Firefox remain; Edge/IE untested
+ tracer context menu for PDE's should go to PopGraph2D
+ 3D views should share/copy camera settings (only works for perspective camera; gets out of sync if camera type of one view is changed)
+ switching between 3D views can clear the scene (or not show it) - cannot reproduce...
+ pinch zoom does not work for LineGraph
+ add mouse drag and touch shift to view of LineGraph
+ touch context menu for MVConsole not working
+ tapping context menu does not close tooltip in another graph
+ tapping on another graph does not close tooltip (unless a node is hit)
+ evoludoViews refusing focus cause trouble in Firefox
+ multiple 3D graphs not shown on view change (or after load); last added graph shown when tooltips are triggered with mouse (currently the only one with mouse listeners). after clicking reset all graphs are shown as expected.
+ tooltips, context menu and picking with multiple 3D views not working (best solution would be that all graphs are widgets with their own event handlers, canvas and tooltips).
+ increase z-index of overlay (currently 'structure' label of background lab floats above overlay)
+ surprisingly drag'n'drop works even in ePubs; is this needed or confusing? disabled for labs in text flow but left enabled for standalone labs.
+ logging in ePubs is painful - fails on any invalid character
	- newlines are a challenge in MVConsole output
	- new class ConsoleLogHandler encodes log messages to prevent crashes when logging to iBooks console. leads to some duplicate encodings; review with MVConsole log handlers in mind
	- disable console logging in ePubs except for debugging?
+ labs on non-linear pages:
	- mouse and keyboard work as expected (as in browser) -> keep
	- export/restore does not work -> disable
	- evoludoCLO enable/disable with isEPub does not work
	- isEPub should reflect actual capability; introduce another flag to request non-linear content labs
	- include drag'n'drop if reader has mouse support
	- help gets encoded twice
+ scrolling of MVConsole does not work (likely blocked by iBooks); cannot seem to force scrollbar visibility; context menu shows up but does not work (interferes with marking of text); remove MVConsole?
+ ePub labs in text flow:
	- do not add wheel listeners to canvas (ignored by ibooks);
	- ignore key events (except for 'alt' provided that ePubReaderTouchSupport); note: isShowing is not working in ePubs and hence key events are sent to all labs (at least in current chapter).
	- ignore/reimagine context menu (set timer after touchstart etc.)
	- ignore drag'n'drop 
+ EvoLudo(Web).isEPub should not be static; add command line option to set features (would help with testing/debugging ePub features); e.g. --gui epub:nomouse:nokeys possible solution to override isEPub setting if lab is running in non-linear page.
+ ePubs no longer throw errors! macOS TouchEvents patched
+ setting of status after parsing errors works but immediately gets overridden.
+ provide logger to test routines in MersenneTwister; must not rely on EvoLudo stuff
+ restored ODE/SDE states won't run...
+ PDE states not (yet) saved/restored
+ --mutation has issues at least with cSD (reverts param to -1 or claims --mutation is an unknown option)
+ --run ignored
+ check if exchange of evoludo states between GWT and JRE is possible -> possible and works!
+ align restored dynamics and original one (kaleidoscopes provide good starting point) -> restoreFitness must set scores _and_ recalculate fitness
+ JRE frequent concurrent modification error in FrameLayer.paintComponent when iterating through tickLabels... -> synchronization added (hackish...)
+ GWT chrome saves dataURL of svg's only up to first '#' character... -> needs to be escaped
+ JRE: command line options for save/restore
+ JRE: adapt PlistParser, PlistReader to work again with file input/output -> not needed, work with strings
+ save more state data (e.g. absorbed etc.) -> not more data needed but updating strategiesTypeCount/Mean
+ GWT: file chooser for save/restore -> ok for restore; impossible for save but now download is triggered, which works in most browsers
+ save/restore RNG state
