TODO:

Save & restore state:
- JRE: command line options for save/restore
- JRE: adapt PlistParser, PlistReader to work again with file input/output
- GWT: drop cursor does not show

DONE:
+ save more state data (e.g. absorbed etc.) -> not more data needed but updating strategiesTypeCount/Mean
+ GWT: file chooser for save/restore -> ok for restore; impossible for save but now download is triggered, which works in most browsers
+ save/restore RNG state
