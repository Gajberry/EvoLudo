TODO:

Save & restore state:
- GWT: drop cursor does not show
- align restored dynamics and original one (kaleidoscopes provide good starting point)
- check if exchange of evoludo states between GWT and JRE is possible

DONE:
+ JRE frequent concurrent modification error in FrameLayer.paintComponent when iterating through tickLabels... -> synchronization added (hackish...)
+ GWT chrome saves dataURL of svg's only up to first '#' character... -> needs to be escaped
+ JRE: command line options for save/restore
+ JRE: adapt PlistParser, PlistReader to work again with file input/output -> not needed, work with strings
+ save more state data (e.g. absorbed etc.) -> not more data needed but updating strategiesTypeCount/Mean
+ GWT: file chooser for save/restore -> ok for restore; impossible for save but now download is triggered, which works in most browsers
+ save/restore RNG state
