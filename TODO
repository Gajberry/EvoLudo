TODO:

- switching to --popupdate S with geometry != well-mixed should trigger warning and reset GUI (surprisingly challenging...); switching to --popupdate D works but existing structure/network is not updated in GUI. 
- add (pseudo) game Test that sports only the console and runs various tests
- move control of model to engine (EvoLudoLab and EvoLudoWeb should only deal with gui stuff)
- drag'n'drop restore does not work on popup labs
- pinch zoom works on touch pad but zoom direction is flipped as compared to iPad (does this make sense...?)
- export on iOS fails (disable or check if data url's work)
- 3D graphs not shown after view change (or on load), tooltips trigger display (desktop Safari only, works in Chrome, Firefox and Safari for iOS)
- fixation probability does not seem to work if initfreqs is e.g. 1:1. this is not intuitive. either change the x-axis from node to something more meaningful and report results graphically or display a message.
- check reference lines for fixation probabilities and times (seem to be off for Moran on test page and do not seem to get updated e.g. when changing population size).

ibooks (desktop):
- standalone: clo options textarea disabled/read-only (corresponding buttons ok)
- standalone: cannot change view (eliminates all entries from view selector)
- LinearGraph: shifting/zooming view does not work (shift sets x-axis [-1,0] to [0,1], zoom out changes to [0,0]...)

ePub:
- important: standalone pages report as ePub in iBooks desktop but false on iBooks on iPad (i.e. export menu is active but not working...)
- touch events require special attention; work different from browser; restrict to mouse events? currently tooltips and context menu are interfering
- pinch zoom has issues for LineGraph (work reasonably well e.g. for PopGraph2D and well for PopGraph3D, including shifting/rotating of view)
- parameter textarea does not show parameters, possibly white on white, may need explicitly setting color of disabled text (iPad only; desktop ok and standalone on iPad ok as well)
- highlighting does not work; likely caused by TouchEvents (appears that touchmove and mousemove interfere; try to avoid loading of TouchEvents and replace by ibooks.js (see Fixed Layout example, i.e. how does it prevent the loading of TouchEvents).)

Minor:
- center histograms
- GWT: drop cursor does not show during drag'n'drop
- MersenneTwister maintains (undesirable) dependency on EvoLudo for encoding state

CHECK:


DONE:
+ move control of model to engine (EvoLudoLab and EvoLudoWeb should only deal with gui stuff)
+ move cloRun to EvoLudo (including isSuspended and potentially isRunning); now code duplication in EvoLudoLab and EvoLudoWeb
+ tooltips do not work towards left part of canvas (findNode seems to fail)
+ review groupScores: should return traitScores (just like avgScores and meanScores); delete 'me', should be included in group; group should be trait counts not indexes.
+ cannot seem to stop simulations on page flip; maybe at least prevent more than one from running? (done but needs testing - ok)
+ ePub triggers should be typeset using html and css only - no need to get javascript involved!
+ ePub context menu not working (intentional?) - no!
+ tap moves background of popup labs (i.e. behind overlay)
+ add double tap for setting initial frequencies in S3Graph and ParaGraph
+ shaking of 3D graphs with keys in overlay is passed to graphs below (ok for 2D graphs)
+ fullscreen not working (except in safari): size of graphs not adjusted - now working in Safari & Chrome; minor scaling issues in Firefox remain; Edge/IE untested
+ tracer context menu for PDE's should go to PopGraph2D
+ 3D views should share/copy camera settings (only works for perspective camera; gets out of sync if camera type of one view is changed)
+ switching between 3D views can clear the scene (or not show it) - cannot reproduce...
+ pinch zoom does not work for LineGraph
+ add mouse drag and touch shift to view of LineGraph
+ touch context menu for MVConsole not working
+ tapping context menu does not close tooltip in another graph
+ tapping on another graph does not close tooltip (unless a node is hit)
+ evoludoViews refusing focus cause trouble in Firefox
+ multiple 3D graphs not shown on view change (or after load); last added graph shown when tooltips are triggered with mouse (currently the only one with mouse listeners). after clicking reset all graphs are shown as expected.
+ tooltips, context menu and picking with multiple 3D views not working (best solution would be that all graphs are widgets with their own event handlers, canvas and tooltips).
+ increase z-index of overlay (currently 'structure' label of background lab floats above overlay)
+ surprisingly drag'n'drop works even in ePubs; is this needed or confusing? disabled for labs in text flow but left enabled for standalone labs.
+ logging in ePubs is painful - fails on any invalid character
	- newlines are a challenge in MVConsole output
	- new class ConsoleLogHandler encodes log messages to prevent crashes when logging to iBooks console. leads to some duplicate encodings; review with MVConsole log handlers in mind
	- disable console logging in ePubs except for debugging?
+ labs on non-linear pages:
	- mouse and keyboard work as expected (as in browser) -> keep
	- export/restore does not work -> disable
	- evoludoCLO enable/disable with isEPub does not work
	- isEPub should reflect actual capability; introduce another flag to request non-linear content labs
	- include drag'n'drop if reader has mouse support
	- help gets encoded twice
+ scrolling of MVConsole does not work (likely blocked by iBooks); cannot seem to force scrollbar visibility; context menu shows up but does not work (interferes with marking of text); remove MVConsole?
+ ePub labs in text flow:
	- do not add wheel listeners to canvas (ignored by ibooks);
	- ignore key events (except for 'alt' provided that ePubReaderTouchSupport); note: isShowing is not working in ePubs and hence key events are sent to all labs (at least in current chapter).
	- ignore/reimagine context menu (set timer after touchstart etc.)
	- ignore drag'n'drop 
+ EvoLudo(Web).isEPub should not be static; add command line option to set features (would help with testing/debugging ePub features); e.g. --gui epub:nomouse:nokeys possible solution to override isEPub setting if lab is running in non-linear page.
+ ePubs no longer throw errors! macOS TouchEvents patched
+ setting of status after parsing errors works but immediately gets overridden.
+ provide logger to test routines in MersenneTwister; must not rely on EvoLudo stuff
+ restored ODE/SDE states won't run...
+ PDE states not (yet) saved/restored
+ --mutation has issues at least with cSD (reverts param to -1 or claims --mutation is an unknown option)
+ --run ignored
+ check if exchange of evoludo states between GWT and JRE is possible -> possible and works!
+ align restored dynamics and original one (kaleidoscopes provide good starting point) -> restoreFitness must set scores _and_ recalculate fitness
+ JRE frequent concurrent modification error in FrameLayer.paintComponent when iterating through tickLabels... -> synchronization added (hackish...)
+ GWT chrome saves dataURL of svg's only up to first '#' character... -> needs to be escaped
+ JRE: command line options for save/restore
+ JRE: adapt PlistParser, PlistReader to work again with file input/output -> not needed, work with strings
+ save more state data (e.g. absorbed etc.) -> not more data needed but updating strategiesTypeCount/Mean
+ GWT: file chooser for save/restore -> ok for restore; impossible for save but now download is triggered, which works in most browsers
+ save/restore RNG state
